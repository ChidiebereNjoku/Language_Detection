# Language Detection Model
## Description
Language Detection Model is an advanced natural language processing (NLP) project designed to identify the language of user-provided text inputs from a set of 17 supported languages. This model excels in accurately distinguishing between different languages using a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier. The project is crucial for various applications such as multilingual customer service, content translation, and linguistic research.

## Features
Accurate Language Detection: Identifies 17 different languages in user-provided text inputs with high precision.
High Accuracy: Utilizes a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier with a test accuracy of 98%.
Real-time Prediction: Provides real-time language detection for user-entered text.
Comprehensive Text Preprocessing: Implements preprocessing techniques including stopwords removal, special characters removal, lemmatization, and lowercasing to improve model performance.
End-to-End Solution: Offers a complete workflow from data preprocessing to full deployment as a web application accessible via this URL: Language Detection App

## Supported Languages
The model can detect the following languages:
Arabic, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Hindi, Italian, Kannada, Malayalam, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Tamil,Turkish

## Importance of Language Model
Language detection models are essential in various domains for effective communication and data processing:

Multilingual Customer Service: Helps in providing personalized support by detecting the customer's language.
Content Translation: Facilitates automatic translation of content to the user's preferred language.
Linguistic Research: Assists in analyzing multilingual text data for research purposes.
Social Media Analysis: Enables understanding of multilingual public opinion and trends.
Content Moderation: Identifies and manages content in multiple languages to maintain community standards.

## Deployment
The deployment process includes end-to-end implementation from data collection to full deployment, ensuring a seamless user experience. This web app can be accessed at this URL: https://sentiment-analyzer-8i7k.onrender.com
